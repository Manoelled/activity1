    <h1>What are Dumplings?</h1>

    <p>
      Dumplings have become extremely popular across the world. More and more
      people are experimenting with new and exciting <br />flavours, combining
      them together to create entirely unique dumplings that are innovative in
      both taste and texture. Due to this<br />
      experimentation, however the question ‘what are dumplings?’ is not so
      simple to answer - but let’s try! In Asian cuisines, dumplings <br />are
      delicate, bite-sized treats of different fillings wrapped in a thin layer
      of dough. They can be both savoury and sweet, and may be <br />boiled,
      steamed and fried - the choice is yours! Known as jiaozi to the Chinese or
      gyoza to the Japanese - the dumpling is a popular<br />
      Asian cuisine to many, regularly consumed and enjoyed.

    <h2><i>Let's get started!</i></h2>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <p>Here are the necessary ingredients to make your Dumplings!</p>
    <br />

    <h2>Wrapper</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 cups water</li>
      <li>1/3 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h2>Filling</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1.5 cups ground pork</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chopped shrimp</li>
      <li>2 cups Napa cabbage</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ginger</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon green onion</li>
      <li>1.5 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons cooking wine</li>
      <li>1/3 teaspoon white pepper</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Step 1: Making the Wrappers</h1>
    <img

    <br />
    <p>
      <b>Mix the flour, salt, and water in a large bowl.</b> Mix the ingredients
      together until you make a nice, smooth dough.<br />
      Use a wooden spoon to stir the ingredients together until they are fully
      incorporated. This recipe should make about<br />
      20 wrappers.
    </p>
    <h1>Step 2: Let the dough rest for 10 minutes</h1>
    <img
      src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/1a/Make-Chinese-Dumplings-Step-2-Version-5.jpg/aid92254-v4-728px-Make-Chinese-Dumplings-Step-2-Version-5.jpg.webp"
      height="500"
      width="500"
    />
    <br />
    <p>
      This can help the ingredients settle together. As you wait for the dough
      to rest, you can cover the bowl with cling <br />wrap. You can start to
      make the filling for the dumplings while you wait.
    </p>
    <h1>Step 3: Slice n' Dice</h1>
    <img

      height="500"
      width="500"
    />
    <p>
      Place the dough on a flat surface. A cutting board will work here. Then,
      cut the dough into about 20 or more equal<br />
      pieces for the dumplings. Make each circular wrapper. Simply use your hand
      to pick up each piece of dough and <br />pound it into the board to make a
      small circular disc. Then, use a rolling pin to smooth out each disc until
      it's about <br />3 inches (7.5 cm) in diameter. They don't have to all be
      exactly the same size, but it can help to get them as close <br />to the
      same size as possible. You can add some flour to the rolling pin to keep
      the wrappers from sticking.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h1>Step 4: Store or use the wrappers immediately</h1>
    <img
      src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/1c/Make-Chinese-Dumplings-Step-5-Version-5.jpg/aid92254-v4-728px-Make-Chinese-Dumplings-Step-5-Version-5.jpg.webp"
      height="500"
      width="500"
    />
    <br />
    <p>
      You should either fill the wrappers immediately, or you can store them in
      the fridge to keep them fresh while you <br />
      make the filling. You can store them for a few days in the fridge, or you
      can even freeze them to store them long-<br />term. Just make sure to coat
      them with flour so they don't stick to each other.

    <p>
      <b>Shred the cabbage and put into a stainless pot.</b>If you'd like to be
      extra thorough, then you can add a dash of salt to<br />
      the cabbage and let it sit in a bowl for 10 minutes; this will allow the
      salt to soak up the excess moisture in the <br />dumplings.
      <b>Mix the cabbage and minced meat together by hand.</b> Ground meat is
      meat finely chopped by a meat <br />grinder. The process of mincing is
      usually done manually.<b
        >Continue mixing the cabbage and meat together until <br />
        they are thoroughly blended.</b
      >
      Pork and lamb are generally preferred for Chinese dumplings, but beef,
      chicken, and <br />turkey may be used as well. In South Asia, both lamb
      (mutton) and goat meat are popular. Add the remaining filling
      <br />ingredients to the bowl and mix again.
      <b
        >Repeat the process until you've thoroughly mixed in the remaining
        ingredients.</b
      ><br />
      If you'd rather use mixing spoons instead of your hands, that will work
      too, but you have to be really thorough.
    </p>
    <h1>Step 2: Scoop the filling onto each wrapper</h1>
    <img
      src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/38/Make-Chinese-Dumplings-Step-11-Version-3.jpg/aid92254-v4-728px-Make-Chinese-Dumplings-Step-11-Version-3.jpg.webp"
      height="500"
      width="500"
    />
    <p>
      Just use a spoon to scoop out 1-2 tablespoons of the mixture in the center
      of every wrapper. You don't have to use <br />the exact same amount in
      every wrapper; just make sure you have enough to use for all 20 or so of
      the wrappers.<br />
      Place the wrapped dumplings on a floured surface. This will keep them from
      sticking to the surface and will make<br />
      your dumplings ready to either boil or fry—it's your choice!
    </p>

    <h1>Final Step: Cooking</h1>
    <p>You can choose to either boil or fry your dumplings.</p>
    <h2>If you want to fry them:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Add 50 milliliters of water to the pan and heat it over high heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the skillet and let it steam until the water has completely
        evaporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then, turn the heat back to medium to continue frying the dumplings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add some oil to the pan and fry the dumplings until they are crispy with
        golden brown bottoms.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If you want to boil them:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Put the dumplings in boiling water.</li>
      <li>
        Then, add 1 or 2 cups of water (it can be cold or at room temperature).
        Wait for it to boil the second time, then <br />add water again.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the water boils the third time, your dumplings should be good to
        go.
      </li>
      <li>Transfer the dumplings carefully from the pot to a plate.</li>
    </ul>
